    <h1>Setting up Visual Studio Code for Electron development and debugging in Typescript</h1>

    <p>The aim of this repository is to help setting up Visual Studio Code for development and debugging of Electron apps in Typescript.</p>

    <p>Visual Studio Code comes with Electron support and Typescript support out of the box, but bringing the two together requires some advanced knowledge of the available configuration options.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/abartho/electron-typescript-vscode">repository</a> contains a README with step by step instructions and an example project to demonstrate how Visual Studio Code, Node, Electron and Typescript must be configured to work together.</p>
