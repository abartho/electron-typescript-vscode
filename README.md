# electron-typescript-vscode

The purpose of this project is to provide a minimal working example of how to set up Visual Studio Code to develop an Electron app in Typescript, including debug support.

Visual Studio Code comes with Electron support and Typescript support out of the box, but bringing the two together requires some deeper understanding of the internals that beginners may not have. This repository contains a Visual Studio Code project with the bare minimum configuration to show how Visual Studio Code, Node, Electron and Typescript must be configured to work together. I aim to keep it up to date as new versions of the used tools and libraries are released.
